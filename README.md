Shopping Trends Analysis Project
This project was developed as part of an AI internship at AICTE. The primary objective was to analyze shopping trends using advanced data analytics techniques to uncover insights into consumer behavior, purchase patterns, and factors influencing sales performance.

Project Overview
This project focuses on:

Extracting insights from historical shopping data.
Identifying patterns in consumer purchasing behavior.
Visualizing key trends to assist stakeholders in decision-making.
Predicting future trends using statistical analysis and machine learning models.
Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Unveiled key trends in sales, customer demographics, and seasonal variations.
Visualization: Used interactive charts and graphs to present insights effectively.
Trend Prediction: Applied machine learning algorithms to predict future sales trends and customer preferences.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly
Scikit-learn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
Key Insights
